TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT p_2_out_BUFG_inst_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks

Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.100 ns between latch_idex/rd_dir_tmp_reg[2]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and etapa_id/gp/reg_a_reg[0]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#308 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.104 ns between latch_idex/rd_dir_tmp_reg[2]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and etapa_id/gp/reg_a_reg[2]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#309 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.147 ns between latch_idex/rd_dir_tmp_reg[2]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and etapa_id/gp/reg_b_reg[3]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on i_reset relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>
